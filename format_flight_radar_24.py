# Author: Wesley Gon√ßalves da Silva - IST1105271
# Purpose:
#     This script processes multiple flight data CSV files from a specified folder,
#     combines them into a single DataFrame, cleans and converts some data columns,
#     assigns unique flight IDs using the Traffic library, and finally saves the 
#     processed data into a new CSV file.
# 
# Inputs:
#     - folder_path: Path to the folder containing multiple CSV files with flight data.
#     Each CSV file is expected to have columns including 'timestamp' and 'altitude'.
#     
# Outputs:
#     - A single CSV file combining all input CSV files, with cleaned and standardized data,
#       and with unique flight IDs assigned, saved at the specified output_file path.
# 
# Additional Comments:
#     - The 'timestamp' column is converted to pandas datetime format for consistency.
#     - The 'altitude' values are converted from feet to meters by multiplying by 0.3048.
#     - The Traffic library (from traffic.core) is used to assign unique IDs to individual flights.
#     - This script assumes all CSV files in the folder are compatible and have consistent structure.
#     - The print statement references a variable 'new_file_name' which should be updated to 'output_file' to avoid errors.
#     - The plt.show() at the end is included but no plot is generated in this code snippet; it may be unnecessary.
